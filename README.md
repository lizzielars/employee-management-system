# CMIS 141 - Introductory Programming - Final Project
The purpose of the Final Project is to create a Java program that acts as an employee
information management system. 

The program displays a menu with six options. 

The first option allows the user to enter employee information (name, employee ID number, and annual salary) for multiple people. 

The second option allows the user to enter one new employee along with their information. 

The third option displays all the employees along with their information. 

The fourth option searches for an employee based on the employee ID number the user enter and displays the employeeâ€™s information. 

The fifth option allows the enter to search for employees with a certain salary range and then displays their information. 

The sixth and last option exits the program.
